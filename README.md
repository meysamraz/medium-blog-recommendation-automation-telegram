# Medium Blog Recommendation Automation
Reading blogs and articles has become a daily habit for me. Medium is an online publishing platform website that I use on a daily basis, and I decided to combine it with the Telegram app that I use every day for the convenience of my work, using a Telegram bot and data from the site's recommendation. Medium recommends me to collect articles related to my favorite topics and use them daily for myself through the Telegram bot.

# Project Overview :

# Get recommended blogs 
I found that Medium fetches the suggested blogs from a QL graph api, which I used for this project.
